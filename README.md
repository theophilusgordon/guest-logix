## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Primary programming language for the application frontend and backend.
- **Angular**: Frontend framework for building web applications.
- **Angular Material**: UI components and design elements.
- **SCSS**: Styling language for enhanced UI design.
- **NGXS**: State management library for Angular applications.
- **NestJS**: Backend framework for building web applications.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing application data.
- **Prisma**: Object-relational mapping (ORM) library for TypeScript.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for building and deploying applications.
- **Jest**: Unit testing framework for Angular applications.
- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing framework for Angular applications.

## Project Structure

- The project is structured using the [Monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) architecture.
- This means that the frontend and backend applications are contained in a single repository.

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `yarn install`.
3. Configure your environment variables.
4. Run the frontend application using `nx serve:app`.

For detailed setup instructions, please refer to the [Setup and Installation Guide](/docs/setup.md).

## Design and UI Elements

- The frontend application is designed using the [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) UI component library.
- This provides a consistent and intuitive user experience.
- It also allows for easy customization of the application design.
- The styling is done using the [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) styling language.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication

- User registration and login with JWT authentication.

### 2. Visitor Management

- Effortlessly manage visitor check-ins and check-outs.

### 3. Access Control

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for different user roles (guest, host, admin).

### 4. Reporting

- Access and export custom reports in CSV and PDF formats.

### 5. User Profile

- Allow users to update their profiles and preferences.

## User Authentication

- Users are authenticated using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This is a secure and stateless method of authentication.
- It also allows for easy integration with the backend API.
- The JWT is stored in the browser's local storage. This allows the user to remain logged in even after closing the browser.
- The JWT is also automatically refreshed when it expires. This ensures that the user is always authenticated.
- The JWT is removed from the local storage when the user logs out.

## Data Presentation

- How data is presented in a user-friendly way, including charts, tables, and visualizations.

## Customization

- Options for users to customize their experience and settings.

## Start the app

- To start the development backend run `nx serve gl-server`.
- To start the development frontend run `nx serve gl-client`.
- To start both the backend and frontend run `nx serve guest-logix`.
- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!


## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:
nx <target> <project> <...options>


You can also run multiple targets:
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
..or add `-p` to filter specific projects
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build guest-logix` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)
